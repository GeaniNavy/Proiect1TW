            <p>	Cottages, double-decker buses, lots of tea and grey, rainy weather. We all know about those, but there is much more than that when it comes to England. The largest part of the four "home nations" that make up the United Kingdom has lots to offer to the tourists, being a green and pleasant land and the most happening place in the world, both at the same time.</p>

                <p>Popularly known as the world's "living art gallery", Italy is an exotic place of both art and architectural masterpieces created throughout history, attracting hundreds of thousands of travelers each year. No visit to Italy is complete without a trip to see the most remarkable cathedral in Europe, the Leaning Tower of Pisa. You can visit Rome to look for antique treasures from several of the world's most famous painters. Florence is awash in history with ancient churches, villas, and palazzos. Every turn in Venice is a piece of history, whether it's a 13th century church, renaissance piazza, or monument. The Doge's Palace and the Bridge of Sighs are just a couple landmarks worth ment</p>

                <p>France, with its splendid beauty, is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world, attracting more than 80 million tourists each year. There are a hundred or more reasons why France attracts travelers from around the world: a city, a mountain range, cathedrals, museums, a French cheese, a chateaux, or simply the charme Francais (French charm). All of these things together creates a country that never ceases to amaze visitors.</p>
